\section{Introduction (Task 3 recap)}
In Task 3, we explored the Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication framework, which facilitates interaction among autonomous agents in distributed systems. 
A2A's extension mechanism allows agents to dynamically adapt their communication protocols based on context and requirements. 
However, while A2A provides a flexible structure for agent interactions, it lacks a formal semantic layer that ensures deterministic communication and verifiable coordination among agents. 
This gap presents challenges in scenarios where agents must reliably delegate tasks, negotiate roles, or coordinate actions without ambiguity.

This gap raises critical questions: How can agents achieve deterministic communication within A2A's extension mechanism? What formal semantics are necessary for verifiable multi-agent coordination? Can a typed semantic layer maintain A2A's flexibility while enabling reliable task delegation and negotiation?


\section{Research Questions and Hypotheses}

\paragraph{Refined questions}
\textbf{Goal:} Clarity + Feasibility + Relevance.\\
\textbf{Strategy:} 
\subparagraph{Attempt 1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How can agents achieve deterministic communication within A2A's extension mechanism?
  \item What formal semantics are required  for verifiable multi-agent coordination?
  \item Can a typed semantic layer be integrated into A2A without compromising its adaptability?
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Attempt 2}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How can LLM-based agents achieve deterministic communication within A2A's extension mechanism?
  \item Will the integration of a typed semantic layer improve task delegation and negotiation among LLM-based agents?
  \item What formal semantics are required  for verifiable and deterministic coordination of the LLM-based agents?
  \item Can a typed semantic layer be integrated into A2A framework without compromising its adaptability?
  \item Will the proposed semantic layer affect small and large scale MAS differently?
  \item Will the proposed semantic layer affect MAS made of SLMs, LLMs, hybrid set differently?
\end{enumerate}

\subparagraph{Attempt 3}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Will the integration of a typed semantic layer in A2A framework bring determinism into collaborative activities among LLM-based agents?
  \item What formal semantics are necessary and sufficient for deterministic coordination of the LLM-based agents?
  \item Will the proposed semantic layer affect various scale MAS (from 2 to 10 agents) differently?
  \item Will the proposed semantic layer affect MAS made of different language model (small, foundation) types differently?
\end{enumerate}
