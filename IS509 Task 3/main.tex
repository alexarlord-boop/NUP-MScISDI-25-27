\section{Introduction}

Core Idea: AGI on SLMs.\\
Intuitive solution: transfer necessary knowledge, ethics, critical thinking and other useful abilities to Small Language Models (SLMs)\\


\subsection{Background/context}
\paragraph{What is AGI?}  AGI is a hot topic; \textbf{however}, is not yet practically implemented.

\paragraph{Key characteristics of AGI} Generalization: The ability to transfer knowledge and skills learned in one area to another, helping it adapt to new and unseen situations.
Common sense: A vast repository of common knowledge about the world, allowing it to reason and make decisions based on a broad understanding.
Abstract thinking: The capacity for abstract thought, planning, and conceptualization, far beyond the capabilities of current AI.
Adaptability: The ability to learn and perform tasks it was not specifically trained for, without human intervention.
Self-awareness: The potential for a degree of self-understanding and autonomous self-control. 

\paragraph{AGI vs current AI}

\paragraph{Areas of human cognition} perception, attention, memory, language, executive function, and reasoning

\paragraph{Approaches to studying human cognition} cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, cognitive neuropsychology and computational cognitive science.


\paragraph{What is SLM?} SLMs are hardware and energy-efficient; \textbf{however}, they still lack performance in general tasks.\\




\subsection{Statement of the problem}
Define necessary and sufficient conditions for AGI $\hookrightarrow$ conceptual model $\hookrightarrow$ Implement on SLMs up to 10B parameters size.

\subsection{Justification of significance}


\subsection{Scope and limitations}
Intuitive requirements: resources for training and tuning of the models.
