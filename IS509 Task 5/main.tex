\section{Introduction: interview}

\paragraph{Interview topic:} Remote Work Experience During the Pandemic.

\paragraph{A)}
\subparagraph{Interviewer:} Can you describe how your work life changed when you started working from home
during the pandemic?
\subparagraph{Participant:} At first, it was honestly very strange. I missed the routine of going to the office,
getting coffee with colleagues, just... having that buzz around me. But over time, I started to
appreciate the flexibility. I could start earlier, take short breaks when needed, and it made
balancing family life much easier.

\paragraph{B)}
\subparagraph{Interviewer:} What aspects did you find most challenging?
\subparagraph{Participant:} The main challenge was staying focused. There were so many distractions — kids,
household chores, even just the temptation to relax. Also, communication with my team became
harder. We used video calls, but it wasn’t the same. Sometimes misunderstandings happened
because we couldn’t read each other’s body language.


\paragraph{C)}
\subparagraph{Interviewer:} How did your organization support you during that period?
\subparagraph{Participant:} They tried. We had weekly check-ins, and our manager encouraged us to take
mental health days. But I think they underestimated how exhausting constant online meetings
could be. I often felt drained by the end of the day.


\paragraph{D)}
\subparagraph{Interviewer:} Looking back, do you think remote work had more positive or negative effects
overall?
\subparagraph{Participant:} Hmm, I’d say mixed. Personally, it gave me more control over my schedule and
reduced stress from commuting. But socially, it made me feel isolated. I missed the informal
chats — that’s where a lot of creativity and problem-solving used to happen.


\paragraph{E)}
\subparagraph{Interviewer:} Would you prefer to continue working remotely in the future?
\subparagraph{Participant:} Probably a hybrid model. I think a few days at home and a few at the office would be
ideal. It keeps the flexibility but still allows that human connection.
